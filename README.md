# AWS-Serverless-Banking-project
In this project, we will implement a Serverless Banking App (AccountBalanceStatus) using AWS API Gateway, AWS Lambda and S3.
Then we will run the application end to end by checking the AccountBalance Status by invoking the REST API which triggers Lambda function and reads data from JSON object in S3 bucket.

We will use AWS CloudFormation (Infrastructure as Code)  to create following Services :
1. AWS API Gateway
2. AWS Lambda
3. AWS  S3 
4. IAM Role
5. Lambda Invoke Permission
6. API Gateway Methods
7. API Gateway Resources
8. API Gateway Stages
9. REST API
